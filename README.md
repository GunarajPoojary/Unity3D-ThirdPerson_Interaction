# Third-Person Interaction System for Unity

A robust and extensible interaction system for third-person Unity games, designed to manage interactions with objects like chests, doors, NPCs, and in-world UI prompts.  
This system focuses on modularity, clean architecture using ScriptableObjects for event-driven communication, and visual feedback for intuitive gameplay.

## Features

- Interaction system using `IInteractable` and `IHighlightable` interfaces  
- Highlight interactable objects with layer-based outline visuals  
- Supports multiple interaction types:
    - Talk  
    - PickUp  
    - OpenClose  
    - Open  
- Event-driven architecture using generic `EventChannel<T>`  
- Handles interaction UI prompts (interaction type, anchored near interactable)  
- Smooth third-person camera control  
- Footstep and landing sounds triggered by animation events  
- Customizable jump, sprint, and movement settings  
- Chat bubble UI for displaying messages  
- Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns

## System Architecture

### Core Concepts
- Interactable Objects implement `IInteractable` and optionally `IHighlightable`.  
- Event Channels (`EventChannel<T>`) decouple event producers and consumers, making the system highly modular and extensible.  
- `InteractionSensor` continuously detects interactable objects in range.  
- `InteractionController` listens for user input and manages interaction logic.  
- `UIInteraction` handles showing/hiding interaction prompts.  
- `OutlineHighlighter` applies layer-based highlighting.

### Key Components

#### Interfaces
- `IInteractable`: Defines `Interact()` method, `InteractableType`, and `UIAnchor`.  
- `IHighlightable`: Defines `Highlight()` and `UnHighlight()`.

#### Event Channels
- `VoidEventChannelSO`: For events with no parameters.  
- `IInteractableEventChannelSO`: For broadcasting interactable objects.  
- `InteractableHoverUIEventChannelSO`: Passes `(Transform, InteractableType)` on hover.

#### Interactable Implementations
- **Chest**: Opens chest lid on interaction.  
- **Door**: Opens and closes two-part sliding door.  
- **DoorComputer**: Triggers door interaction.  
- **Suitedman**: Plays interaction animation + shows chat bubble.

#### Player Components
- **PlayerController**: Manages movement, jumping, sprinting, and gravity.  
- **CameraThirdPersonLook**: Third-person camera controller.  
- **MovementAnimationEventTrigger**: Handles footstep and landing audio.

#### UI Components
- **ChatBubble**: Displays messages from interactables.  
- **UIInteraction**: Displays interaction prompts above interactable objects.

## Usage

### 1. Setup Scene
- Add `InteractionSensor` and `InteractionController` to your player.  
- Configure layer mask to specify which layers contain interactable objects.  
- Attach `InputReader` for reading player input.

### 2. Create Interactable Objects
- Implement `IInteractable` interface.  
- Assign `UIAnchor` and set `InteractableType`.  
- Attach `OutlineHighlighter` with the appropriate visuals.  
- Create and link event channels via ScriptableObjects.

### 3. Input System Integration
- Configure `InputReader` to trigger interaction, sprint, and jump actions.

### 4. UI Setup
- Setup `UIInteraction` prefab with TextMeshPro for displaying prompts.  
- Setup `ChatBubble` prefab for NPC dialogues.

## Example Interaction Flow

1. Player approaches a chest → `InteractionSensor` detects it → raises `OnInteractableFound`.  
2. `InteractionController` highlights chest and shows interaction UI prompt.  
3. Player presses interact button → chest opens via `Interact()` method → layer reset and highlight removed.  
4. `UIInteraction` hides the prompt once interaction is complete.

## Why This System?

- Decoupled, reusable architecture  
- Easy to extend: Add new interactable objects by implementing the interfaces  
- Clear visual feedback  
- Fully configurable via Unity Inspector  
- No monolithic hardcoded logic
